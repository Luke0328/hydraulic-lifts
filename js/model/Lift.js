/**
 * Lift is the general model for the two lifts seen in the simulation.
 * There is an input lift and an output lift.
 *
 * Primary responsibilities:
 *		- Keep track of the center position of each lift
 *		- Keep track of the radius of each lift
 *		- Keep track of the force exerted on the input lift or the force exerted by the output lift
 *
 * The output force changes according to the radii of the lifts and the input force.
 * The lifts move up and down according to the forces. A greater force results in a greater
 * displacement from the starting center position of each lift.
 *
 * For physics background information see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal%27s_law
